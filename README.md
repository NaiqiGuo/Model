# Model

A suite of structures, their vibration responses to strong ground motion events, and analysis to investigate the relationships between ``ground truth'' damage state and estimated damage states obtained from inverse system identification.

## Getting Started

1. `get_systems.py` : finite element model and its system identification.
    - Choose an analysis configuration: "frame", "bridge", or "bridge_multisupport"
